# Contract Manager

This mod has as a goal to provide an easy way to create, manage and complete contracts in KSA.
It allows players to take on various contracts, complete objectives, and earn rewards.
For modders, it provides a flexible API to create custom contracts and objectives.

Finally, the end-goals of this mod are:
- To create an intuitive and user-friendly interface for managing contracts.
- To create a variety of community-driven contract to keep gameplay engaging and guide players beyond sending a rocket to space.
- To create a campaign mode where players can take on a series of contracts with increasing difficulty and complexity.

### Currently implemented features:
- None yet, stay tuned! This mod is still in early development and not released.

### Far future features/ideas:
- Multiplayer support for cooperative and competitive contract completion.
- Have (multi-)player and AI-controlled space agencies that can compete, accept and complete contracts. (spacerace!!!)
- Have non-space agencies that will offer commercial contracts that can influence the KSA economy and reputation system.

**Additional ideas and suggestions are welcome!**
