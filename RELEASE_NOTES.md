# Release Notes

## 0.1.0 2025-12-30 - First version

This is the first released (very alpha) version of this mod. It has the basic implementations to close the loop to offer, accept and complete a contract. 
It still needs a lot of work to offer something close to a set of contracts that can be consiered as tutorials or a campaign.

For now, please try out this mod and give me feedback;
- Which features would you like to see?
- Did you encounter a bug?
- As a fellow modder/coder, how can the mod and it's backend be improved?

Supported KSA versions:
- `v2025.12.31.3103` fully supported
- `v2025.12.33.3123` play supported, loading save-game is broken due to KSA issue.
